GRPC Android Demo
=================

About
-----

As there seems to be currently no ready-to-go example for an Android application communicating with
a GRPC server which doesn't involve setting up a boatload of tools we decided to create this simple
demo project which contains a simple GRPC Java server and a matching Android client.

The setup contains working code generation so feel free to change the proto file in lib_hello_grpc.
Upon the next build the necessary classes are generated by the gradle grpc plugin. You'll just have
to adapt the server and client code to the newly generated GRPC java classes. The compiler will 
point you to the locations you have to change by means of compilitation errors.

Setup
-----

The following documentation assumes that you've installed Android Studio. Import the project via
gradle.

Running the server
------------------

By default the server runs on port 8080, but you may change that via command line arguments or
directly in the code.

Run the server from Android Studio by right-clicking the `Server.java` in the `lib_hello_grpc`
module. This also creates a suitable run configuration which you can use to run the server again
later. Make sure, that only one server instance runs at a time (at least if you attempt to use the
same port).

Incoming requests are logged on stdout.

Running the client
------------------

While importing the project to Android Studio via gradle the IDE automatically generates a run
configuration for the app which you can use to install it on your device or emulator.

In the app first type in the hostname and the port of your server. Then click on the `HELLO SERVER!`
button to execute a request against your GRPC server instance. In case of success the server will
reply with `Hello Android`.

If you did everything correctly it should look something like this:
